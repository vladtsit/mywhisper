   - Progress is displayed in real-time

4. **Text Correction**:
   - Raw transcription is processed through GPT-4 for grammar and clarity
   - Customizable correction prompts via Settings
   - Both original and corrected text are displayed

5. **Output**:
   - Corrected text is automatically copied to clipboard
   - All files and transcripts are saved locally for future reference

### Settings Management
- Access comprehensive settings through the Settings window
- Configure Azure OpenAI credentials and endpoints
- Customize text correction prompts
- Manage file storage locations
- All sensitive data is encrypted and stored securely

### Logging & Monitoring
- Built-in runtime logging system tracks all operations
- Filter logs by level, timestamp, or content
- Export logs for troubleshooting or analysis
- Monitor application performance and errors

## Security

### Data Protection
- **Encrypted Settings**: All sensitive configuration data (API keys, endpoints) is encrypted using Microsoft Data Protection APIs
- **Local Storage**: Settings and logs are stored locally on your machine, never transmitted to third parties
- **Secure Communication**: All Azure OpenAI API calls use HTTPS encryption
- **No Data Retention**: Audio files and transcripts are processed and stored locally only

### Best Practices
- Never commit your Azure OpenAI API keys to version control
- Use environment variables or Azure Key Vault for production deployments
- Ensure your Azure OpenAI resource has appropriate access controls and networking restrictions
- Regularly rotate your API keys according to your organization's security policy
- Monitor usage through Azure portal to detect any unauthorized access

### Privacy Considerations
- Audio recordings are processed locally and via Azure OpenAI APIs only
- No audio data is stored by the application beyond your local machine
- Transcribed text remains on your local system unless explicitly shared
- Runtime logs contain operational data but no sensitive content

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Audio not recording**: 
   - Check microphone permissions in Windows Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Microphone
   - Ensure your microphone is set as the default recording device
   - Try running the application as administrator

2. **File upload not working**:
   - Verify file format is supported (WAV, MP3, MP4, MOV, AVI, M4A)
   - Check that FFmpeg is properly installed for file processing
   - Ensure file size is reasonable (large files will be chunked automatically)

3. **Transcription fails**: 
   - Verify Azure OpenAI endpoint and API key in Settings
   - Check that Whisper deployment name matches your Azure configuration
   - Monitor Runtime Logs for detailed error information

4. **Text correction not working**:
   - Confirm GPT-4 deployment name in Settings
   - Check API key permissions for GPT models
   - Verify custom correction prompt syntax

5. **Settings not saving**:
   - Ensure application has write permissions to user data folder
   - Check Windows event logs for data protection errors
   - Try running as administrator if encryption issues persist

6. **Build errors**: 
   - Ensure .NET 8.0 SDK is installed
   - Verify all NuGet packages are restored: `dotnet restore`
   - Check for any missing dependencies in project files

### Logging and Diagnostics

- Use the **Runtime Logs** window to monitor real-time application activity
- Filter logs by severity level (Error, Warning, Info, Debug)
- Export logs for detailed analysis or when reporting issues
- Check the `Logs` folder in the application directory for persistent log files

### Performance Optimization

- Large audio files are automatically chunked for better performance
- Transcription progress is displayed in real-time
- Settings are cached locally to minimize API calls
- Audio processing uses background threads to maintain UI responsiveness
